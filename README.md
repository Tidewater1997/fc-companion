## What does this do?

When you visit [http://fantasticcontraption.com/](http://fantasticcontraption.com/) levelId=###### or designId=######, this app automatically opens the desktop version of the game for you. (for example, this link http://FantasticContraption.com/?levelId=572295). This app is for people that do not want to enable the now outdated Flash player in order to have a smooth experience.
